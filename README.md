# Project_Contacts_PhoneBook_K10
This project created during the learning 
process

This program is for creating a phone book 
of contacts (like in a mobile phone) and 
searching for people or organizations by 
name.

The menu:
- add - add new contact
- list - show, edit or delete contacts
- search - search function
- count - how many contacts the phone 
book has
- exit - program completion

Implemented saving to a file and loading 
from a file. To save contacts, you must 
specify the file you are working with as 
a command line argument. This will 
automatically save contacts to your 
hard drive after each action that changes 
the data. If you don't provide an 
argument, a new contact list will be 
created. If you specify a file that does 
not exist, an empty contact list will be 
created.
